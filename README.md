# Number-guessing-game
This is a number guessing game. In this game, the user can set the difficulty, set the range the number is found in to avoid an infinite range. The difficulties are easy, medium and hard. These difficulties are time based therefore the harder the difficulty the less time you have to guess the correct number. A pop-up message appears to let you know you have guessed right and won, time has run out therefore you have lost and the timer stops. The times shows how much time you have left. 
There is also a cluebox to let you know whether to guess higher or lower. It is a fun game haha
